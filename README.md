## Design patterns

### Prototype

With ReactJs you can create components and add custom props to get custom components, for this reason, this project was build with [Prototype Design Pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/prototype)

### State

The core of each component is your state, which has your own handle, for this reason, this project was build with [State Design Pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/state)

### Iterator

To render multiple elements in our view, we have our components, which we can iterate each one and set custom props, for this reason, this project was build with [Iterator Design Pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/iterator)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn test:coverage`

Launches the test runner in the intective watch mode with a coverage report.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
