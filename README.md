## Design patterns

### Prototype

With ReactJs you can create components and add custom props to get custom components, for this reason, this project was build with [Prototype Design Pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/prototype)

### State

The core of each component is your state, which has your own handle, for this reason, this project was build with [State Design Pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/state)

### Iterator

To render multiple elements in our view, we have our components, which we can iterate each one and set custom props, for this reason, this project was build with [Iterator Design Pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/iterator)
